models 0.9.7

Python models for schema-less databases.

PyModels is a lightweight framework for mapping Python classes to schema-less databases. It is not an ORM as it doesn’t map existing schemata to Python objects but instead defines them on a higher layer built upon a schema-less storage (key/value or document-oriented). You define models as a valuable subset of the whole database and work with only certain parts of existing entities – the parts you need.

Models were renamed to PyModels

Since 21 Feb 2010 this package is named “PyModels”. It was renamed due to name clashes between the library and local module with concrete models. It is natural to name the latter “models.py” (e.g. in Django), so it would obviously conflict with an external library named “models”.
